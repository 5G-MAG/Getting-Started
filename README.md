The 5G-MAG Reference Tools are a platform to

* receive 5G broadcast (5G BC) in dedicated mode, i.e. using 100 % downlink capacity (also known as EnTV/FeMBMS in 3GPP Rel.14 and LTE-based 5G Terrestrial Broadcast in 3GPP Rel.16)
* combine 5G BC with common (5G) (mobile) broadband, process and cache it for applications
* develop interactive applications and proof-of-concepts for hybrid distribution for broadcaster
* dynamically and seamlessly switch between broadcast and broadband content
