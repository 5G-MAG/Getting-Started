# Documentation-and-Architecture

The 5G-MAG Reference Tools are a platform to

* receive 5G broadcast (5G BC) in dedicated mode, i.e. using 100 % downlink capacity (also known as EnTV/FeMBMS in 3GPP Rel.14 and LTE-based 5G Terrestrial Broadcast in 3GPP Rel.16)
* combine 5G BC with common (5G) (mobile) broadband, process and cache it for applications
* develop interactive applications and proof-of-concepts for hybrid distribution for broadcaster
* dynamically and seamlessly switch between broadcast and broadband content


## 5G-MAG Reference Tools - How to participate
We welcome everyone who is willing to contribute to the 5G-MAG Reference Tools. The participation is not limited to 5G-MAG members, quite the contrary we hope to attract researchers and independent developers into the community. 5G-MAG sponsors the coordination of the development by providing a program management support.
