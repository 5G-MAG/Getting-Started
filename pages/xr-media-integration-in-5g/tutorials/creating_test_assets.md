# MPEG-I Scene Description Test Asset Creation

## Content repositories

5G-MAG is hosting a repository with test assets implementing some of the core extensions defined in MPEG-I Scene Description (ISO/IEC 23090-14): [https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-xr-content](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-xr-content).

Note the assets produced by the MPEG-I SD group are typically available for download at [https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/23090/-24/](https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/23090/-24/).
Khronos hosts sample glTF2.0 assets on GitHub: [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets.git](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets.git.).

## Blender add-on to generate MPEG-I SD compliant glTF2.0 assets

The 5G-MAG Reference Tools also provides a Blender add-on to support [MPEG_* glTF extensions](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor) and export glTF files.

The repository is available here: [https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-xr-blender-exporter](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-xr-blender-exporter)
A tutorial is available here: [Blender glTF Exporter and Unity Player](./blender_exporter_unity_player.html)
