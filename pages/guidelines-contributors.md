## Raising Issues

Anyone can raise issues against projects, you do not need to have signed the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to do so.

## Releases

### Release Process

**TODO: Details of the release process**
- Tagging for release candidates
- Period of RC testing (see [Testing release candidates](#testing-release-candidates))
- If there are blocking issues
  - Fix blockers
  - Create new release candidate
- ... otherwise
  - Package up the release
  - Announce the release on Slack and Google Groups

### Testing release candidates

Availability of a RC for testing is announned in the Google Group and/or during the 5G-MAG Developers Calls. Feedback can be provided via issues during the testing period.

## Git Branching strategy
We are using a slightly modified version of Gitflow as a branching model. A detailed introduction to Gitflow can be found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

#### Main branch
The _main_ branch stores the official release history. The current version of the _main_ branch always stores the latest release.

#### Development branch
The _development_ branch serves as the integration branch for new feature and bugfix branches. It reflects the latest stable changes in the current development cycle.

#### Feature branches
Each new feature is implemented in a separate _feature_ branch. Feature branches use _development_ as their parent branch. When a feature is completed the respective branch gets merged back into development. 

A feature branch is created the following way:
````
git checkout development
git checkout -b feature/newfeature
````

#### Release branches
Once the _development_ branch has acquired enough features and bugfixes for a release, a release candidate branch is created based on the current version of the _development_ branch. For details on the release procedure please refer to the [release procedure](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/DASH-IF-Conformance/wiki/Release-Procedure) documentation.

The release candidate always includes a version number and is created in the following way:

````
git checkout develop
git checkout -b RC-1.2.0
````

Once a release candidate is approved the respective branch is merged into the _main_ branch.

#### Bugfix branches
Similar to _feature_ branches, the _bugfix_ branches are created directly from _development_. In contrast to hotfixes, bugfixes are not considered criticial and do not require a fast new release. _Bugfix_ branches are created the following way:

````
git checkout development
git checkout -b bugfix/newbugfix
````

#### Hotfix branches
_Hotfix_ branches are used to quickly patch production releases in case of critical errors. _Hotfix_ branches are created directly from _main_ and merged back into _main_ and _development_ as soon as they are completed. Once the hotfix is applied a new release shall be created.

````
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/newhotfix
````

#### Cloning a repository with a specific branch
It is also possible to clone a repository and specify the target branch directly:

`git clone -b <branchname> <remote-repo-url>`

## Forking the project
To work on a new feature or a bugfix you first need to fork the repository that you want to work on. A detailed guide how to fork a repository can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

## Pull requests
Once a feature or a hotfix branch is completed a new pull request against the _development_ (in case of _feature_ branches) or the _main_ branch (in case of _hotfix_ branches) is created:

1.  Navigate to the list of available branches. Depending on the concrete setup the new branch is available directly on the main repository or on your fork of the main repository.

3. Select the target (base) branch:
   * For `feature` branches select the `development` branch
   * For `hotfix` branches select the `main` branch
4. Provide a summary of your changes in the textfield
5. Click on "Create pull request"
