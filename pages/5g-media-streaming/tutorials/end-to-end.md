# Tutorial - 5G MSd: Basic End-to-End Setup
This guide describes how to setup and configure the 5G-MAG Reference Tools - 5G Downlink Media Streaming components to create an end to end setup as depicted in the illustration below.

<img width="934" alt="BildschirmÂ­foto 2023-04-06 um 09 35 46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2427039/230307155-c0f71870-a806-4229-966a-41a8f2f838f8.png">

# Versions
This guide requires the following versions:

| Component  | Minimum Version |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Application Function | `1.3.0`  |
| Application Server  | `1.2.0`  |
| 5GMSd Aware Application  | `1.0.0`  |
| Media Session Handler  | `1.0.0`  |
| Media Stream Handler  | `1.0.0`  |
| Common Android Library  | `1.0.0`  |

# Server-side setup
In some cases, you might want to work with a reduced setup to develop new functionality on the client-side. For that reason, the server-side setup guide is divided into two sections the [Option 1: Common server-side setup](#option-1-common-server-side-setup) and [Option 2: Server-side development setup](#option-2-server-side-development-setup).

## Option 1: Common server-side setup

### 1. Installing the Application Function
The first component that we need to install is the **5GMSd Application Function (AF)**. The AF is a network function that forms part of the 5G Media Streaming framework as defined in TS 26.501. AF is a logical function which embodies control plane aspects such as provisioning, configuration, and reporting, among others. Such functions can be provisioned by the 5GMSd Application Provider using a RESTful HTTP-based API (M1d). Another RESTful HTTP-based configuration and reporting API (M5d) is exposed to 5GMSd Clients.

The detailed installation guide for the AF can be found in the corresponding [Github repository](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-function).

### 2. Installing the Application Server
Next, we need to install the **5GMSd Application Server (AS)**. The AS provides 5G Media Streaming services to a population of 5GMSd Clients. This logical function embodies the data plane aspects that deal with media content (for instance, a Content Delivery Network). The content is ingested (both HTTP push- or pull-based are supported) from 5GMSd Application Providers at reference point `M2d`. The content is distributed to 5GMSd Clients at reference point `M4d`, which supports standard pull-based content retrieval protocols (e.g. DASH).

The detailed installation guide for the AS can be found in the corresponding [Github repository](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-server).

### 3. Running the Application Server

Now start the AS 
````
sudo 5gms-application-server 
````

For additional options, refer to the [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-server/blob/main/docs/README.md#running-the-example-without-building). Pay attention to the port configuration of the AS as it requires root permission to run on the standard ports (80 & 443).

### 4.  Running the Application Function
Now that we installed the AF and the AS we can configure the AF. A detailed configuration guide is available in the [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-function/wiki/Configuring-the-Application-Function) of the AF. 

#### Configuration of the AF
For this demo, we will run AF and AS on the same machine. As we want to access the `ServiceAccessInformation` via the `M5d` interface from our Media Session Handler running on an Android device we need to slightly modify the configuration. The goal is to expose the `M5d` interface via the IP address of our machine but have it running on a different port to not interfere with the default port of the `M3`interface on the AS (`Port 7777`). 

1. Open `~/usr/local/etc/open5gs/msaf.yaml`
2. Find the settings for `msaf:m5`
3. Replace the `addr` field with `0.0.0.0` and choose a different `port`. For instance:
````
msaf:
    m5:
      - addr: 0.0.0.0
      - port: 7778
```` 


#### Starting the AF

As we installed the AF as a local user, we start it with the following command:
````
~/usr/local/bin/open5gs-msafd
````
#### Creating a content hosting configuration

There is a guide on how to test the AS with the AF in the [AS Wiki](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-server/blob/main/docs/README.md#testing-with-the-application-function). We are following a slightly different approach as we use the `msaf-configuration` tool that ships with version `1.3.0` of the Application Function. The `msaf-configuration` tool creates a `provisioningSession` and a `contentHostingConfiguration` based on a JSON input file. Moreover, it automatically generates the required `M8` information for us that we will later need on the client-side.

First we create a configuration file to be used by the `msaf-configuration` tool:

````
[af-sync]
m5_authority = <YOUR_MACHINE_IP_HERE>:<M5_PORT_HERE>
#docroot = /var/cache/rt-5gms/as/docroots
#default_docroot = /usr/share/nginx/html
````

Replace `<YOUR_MACHINE_IP_HERE>` with the IP address of your machine and `<M5_PORT_HERE>` with the port that the `M5` interface is running on. For instance:

```` 
[af-sync]
m5_authority = 192.168.178.55:7778
#docroot = /var/cache/rt-5gms/as/docroots
#default_docroot = /usr/share/nginx/html
````

Place this file in `/etc/rt-5gms/af-sync.conf`

Now we define a JSON file with the streams:

````json
{
    "aspId": "5GMAG",
    "appId": "5G-MAG_Reference_Tools",
    "streams": {
	"vod": {
	    "name": "BBC R&D Demo Streams",
	    "ingestURL": "https://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/",
	    "distributionConfigurations": [
		    {"domainNameAlias": "<YOUR_MACHINE_IP_HERE>"}
	    ]
	}
    },
    "vodMedia": [
	{
	    "name": "VoD: Elephant's Dream",
	    "stream": "vod",
	    "entryPoints": [
		{
                    "relativePath": "elephants_dream/1/client_manifest-all.mpd",
                    "contentType": "application/dash+xml",
                    "profiles": ["urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-live:2011"]
                }
	    ]
	},
	{
	    "name": "VoD: Big Buck Bunny",
	    "stream": "vod",
            "entryPoints": [
                {
                    "relativePath": "bbb/2/client_manifest-common_init.mpd",
                    "contentType": "application/dash+xml",
                    "profiles": ["urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-live:2011"]
                }
            ]
	},
	{
	    "name": "VoD: Testcard",
	    "stream": "vod",
            "entryPoints": [
                {
                    "relativePath": "testcard/vod/manifests/avc-full.mpd",
		    "contentType": "application/dash+xml",
                    "profiles": ["urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-live:2011"]
                },
		{
                    "relativePath": "testcard/vod/manifests/avc-full.m3u8",
                    "contentType": "application/x-mpegURL"
                }
	    ]
	}
    ]
}
````

Again, replace `<YOUR_MACHINE_IP_HERE>` with the IP address of your machine.

Place this file in `/etc/rt-5gms/streams.json`

Now [install](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-provider/tree/master/python) and execute the `msaf-configuration` tool:

````
sudo ~/usr/local/bin/msaf-configuration
````

You should see a message like this:
````
INFO:__main__:Publishing M8 info to: /usr/share/nginx/html, /var/cache/rt-5gms/as/docroots/192.168.178.55
````

You can check the response of the `m8` request by opening `http://localhost/m8.json` in your browser. It should look like this:

````
{
  "m5BaseUrl": "http://192.168.178.55:7778/3gpp-m5/v2/",
  "serviceList": [
    {
      "provisioningSessionId": "872a0eb2-e40a-41ed-bf2a-03b8343221a7",
      "name": "VoD: Llama Drama",
      "entryPoints": [
        {
          "locator": "http://192.168.178.55/m4d/provisioning-session-872a0eb2-e40a-41ed-bf2a-03b8343221a7/634cd01c-6822-4630-8444-8dd6279f94c6/CaminandesLlamaDrama4K.ism/manifest(format=mpd-time-csf)",
          "contentType": "application/dash+xml",
          "profiles": [
            "urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-live:2011"
          ]
        },
        {
          "locator": "http://192.168.178.55/m4d/provisioning-session-872a0eb2-e40a-41ed-bf2a-03b8343221a7/634cd01c-6822-4630-8444-8dd6279f94c6/CaminandesLlamaDrama4K.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl-v3)",
          "contentType": "application/vnd.apple.mpegurl"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
````

In our Android application we will use this endpoint later to derive the required information to populate our stream selection drowdown and to query the Application Function via `M5`. 

#### Optional: Creating a server certificate

Optionally, you can now also [create server certificate](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-function/wiki/Testing-the-M1-Interface#server-certificates). For plain `http` based playback we can omit this step.

#### Optional: Checking the M5 interface
The complete documentation on how to test the M5 interface for AF versions 1.2.0 and above can be found [here](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application-function/wiki/Testing-the-M5-Interface-on-v1.2.0)

What we will need on the client side later is the `ServiceAccessInformation`. This will be requested via `M5d` by our MediaSessionHandler. Since retrieving this information is done via a simple HTTP GET request, we can access the information directly in the browser. For that reason, call the following URL and replace `{provisioningSessionId}` with the corresponding value. For instance,

* `http://${msaf.m5.addr}:${msaf.m5.port}/3gpp-m5/v2/service-access-information/${provisioningSessionId}` 

becomes

* `http://192.168.178.55:7778/3gpp-m5/v2/service-access-information/a0b5a258-d5da-41ed-b62f-cdd2806778b0`

The output should look like the following:

````
{
	"provisioningSessionId":	"a0b5a258-d5da-41ed-b62f-cdd2806778b0",
	"provisioningSessionType":	"DOWNLINK",
	"streamingAccess":	{
		"mediaPlayerEntry":	"http://192.168.178.55/m4d/provisioning-session-a0b5a258-d5da-41ed-b62f-cdd2806778b0/BigBuckBunny_4s_onDemand_2014_05_09.mpd"
	}
}
````

## Option 2: Server-side development setup
For development purposes, it can be useful to mock the functionality of the AF and the AS. For that reason, 5G-MAG provides a [simple static webserver](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-examples/tree/main/express-mock-af). The server basically contains two endpoints to query `M8` information and the corresponding `ServiceAccessInformation`. The assets that are linked on the webserver are pointing to third-party CDNs. However, it would also be possible to add media content to the webserver in the `public` folder and thereby simulate a local Application Server.

### 1. Configure the webserver
Open `/express-mock-af/routes/m8.js` and adjust the `m5BaseUrl` to point to your machine.

Install the dependencies:

````
cd express-mock-af
npm install
````

### 2. Starting the webserver

Navigate to the root folder of the server and start it:

````
cd express-mock-af
npm start
```` 

# Client-side setup
Not that we have the server-side setup in place we can focus on the client side. We need to install four components (two libraries, two Android applications) for the end-to-end setup.

## 1. Installing the 5GMSd Common Android Library
The [5GMSd Common Android Library](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-common-android-library) is an Android library that includes models and helper classes used within the different client-side Android applications such as the 5GMSd-Aware Application, 5GMSd Media Stream Handler and the 5GMSd Media Session Handler. 

The installation guide can be found in the [Readme](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-common-android-library#readme) of the project. Note that you need to publish the library to a local maven repository as described in the installation guide. 

## 2. Installing the 5GMSd Media Stream Handler
The [5GMSd Media Stream Handler](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-media-stream-handler) is an Android library that includes the [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) as a dependency. The 5GMSd Media Stream Handler implements an adapter around the ExoPlayer APIs to expose TS.26.512 M7d interface functionality. Moreover, a MediaSessionHandlerAdapter establishes a Messenger connection to the [Media Session Handler](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-media-session-handler). The 5GMSd Media Stream Handler is included as an Android library by 5GMSd Aware Application.

The installation guide can be found in the [Readme](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-media-stream-handler#readme) of the project. Note that you need to publish the library to a local maven repository as described in the installation guide. 

## 3. Installing the 5GMSd Media Session Handler
The [5GMSd Media Session Handler](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-media-session-handler) is an Android application that implements functionality for 5G Media Streaming media session handling. It is implemented as an Android Messenger Service that communicates via Inter Process Communication (IPC) with other Android libraries and applications such as the Media Stream Handler and the 5GMSd Aware Application.

The Media Session Handler communicates with the 5GMSd Application Function via interface M5 to establish and control the delivery of a streaming media session in the downlink direction. In addition, the Media Session Handler exposes APIs via M6 to the 5GMSd-Aware Application and to the Media Player (for downlink streaming).

The installation guide can be found in the [Readme](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-media-session-handler#readme) of the project.

## 4. Configuring and installing the 5GMSd-Aware Application
The 5GMSd-Aware Application is an Android application that serves as a reference implementation for 5GMSd. It uses the [Media Stream Handler](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-media-stream-handle) for playback and communication with the [Media Session Handler](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-media-session-handler).

The 5GMSd Aware Application is an application in the UE, provided by the 5GMSd Application Provider, that contains the service logic of the 5GMSd application service, and interacts with other 5GMSd Client and Network functions via the interfaces and APIs defined in the 5GMSd architecture.

### 4.a Common Configuration 
The 5GMSd-Aware Application supports `m8` input via REST endpoints or local files. For that reason, a configuration file located in `app/src/main/assets/config.properties.xml` is used. It contains a list of the possible `m8` endpoints. Per default, a single 5G-MAG hosted endpoint is linked:

````
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
<properties>
    <entry key="m85GMAGHost">https://rt.5g-mag.com/</entry>
</properties>
```` 

For our local AS and AF setup we only need to extend this list with the `M8` endpoint we created previously:

````
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
<properties>
    <entry key="m8LocalAfAndAs">m8/config_local_af.json</entry>
    <entry key="m85LocalHost">http://<YOUR_MACHINE_IP_HERE>/</entry>
</properties>
````

Replace `<YOUR_MACHINE_IP_HERE>` with the IP of the machine that is running the AF and the AS, for instance:
````
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
<properties>
    <entry key="m8LocalAfAndAs">m8/config_local_af.json</entry>
    <entry key="m85LocalHost">http://192.168.178.55/</entry>
</properties>
````


### 4.a Alternative: Development Configuration 
If you are using the development web server instead of the common AF and AS installation, simply open `app/src/main/assets/config.properties.xml` and uncomment the following two lines. These two local `.json` files correspond to the default configuration on the static webserver.

````
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
<properties>
    <entry key="m8LocalSingleMedia">m8/config_single_media.json</entry>
    <entry key="m8LocalMultiMedia">m8/config_multi_media.json</entry>
</properties>
````

Navigate to `app/src/main/assets/m8` and adjust the IP address of the `m5BaseUrl` in `config_single_media.json` and `config_multi_media.json` to point to your local webserver.

As an alternative, you can also use the `M8` endpoint of the development web server. For that reason, uncomment the following line and replace the IP address with the IP address of your machine.

````
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
<properties>
   <entry key="m8LocalDummyHost">http://192.168.178.55:3003/m8/</entry>
</properties>
````

### 4.b Installation
The installation guide for the 5GMSd-Aware Application can be found in the [Readme](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-5gms-application/tree/development/fivegmag_5GMSdAwareApplication) of the project.


## 5. Running the application
Now that we have performed all the required setup and configuration, we can finally start our client-side applications. Unlock your Android phone and start the `MediaSessionHandler` if it is not already running. Afterwards start the `5GMSd-Aware Application`. Select an `M8` entry from the dropdown and then select one of the available stream URLs. Next, click on _Start Playback_. The output should look like this:
