## Developer Kanban Boards

### 5GMS: Basic Media stream handling (MVP#1)
The main objective for MVP#1 is to implement a starting point for 5G Media Streaming with DASH-based media streaming using 5GMS formats and protocols as the basis. This includes a basic Media Player talking to a simple 5GMS Application Server.
* [**Kanban board**](https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/projects/3)

### 5GMS: Media session handling (MVP#2)
The 5GMSd Media Session Handler retrieves Service Access Information from a 5GMSd Application Function (5GMSd AF) via reference point M5d.
* [**Kanban board**](https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/projects/4)

### 5GMS: M1d Provisioning
Implementation of 5GMSd Provisioning (M1d) APIs
* [**Kanban board**](https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/projects/8)

### 5GMS: M3 Link  (AF to AS RESTful OpenAPI)
Configuration of the 5GMS Application Server by the 5GMS Application Function via an RESTful OpenAPI interface.
* [**Kanban board**](https://github.com/orgs/5G-MAG/projects/6)

### 5GMS: Network Assistance and Dynamic Policies features
Addition of Network Assistance and Dynamic Policies features to the 5GMS components, including integration with the BSF and PCF via new, reusable service consumer libraries.
