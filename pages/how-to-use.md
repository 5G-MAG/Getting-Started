# How to use these pages

This documentation is organized in a hierarchical structure. The main topics are listed in the left sidebar. Each topic
has subcategories, which are listed in the dropdown menu of the main topic.

The subcategories are similar for all the main topics and include information about specifications, related projects,
the corresponding repositories, usage instructions and end-to-end tutorials.

# Subcategories

## Subcategory: Scope

The `Scope` subcategory provides information about the high-level architecture of the respective
project. It includes links to the relevant specifications and standards as well as high-level architecture diagrams
about the technology. It is a good starting point to understand the relevant technologies and to identify the right
specifications to study for a deeper understanding.

## Subcategory: Roadmap

The `Roadmap` subcategory links to the relevant GitHub project boards. Typically, the
development process of major features in the 5G-MAG Reference Tools is tracked in the "5G-MAG Reference Tools Roadmaps" boards.
Developers may use specific boards to track progress on sub-projects.

## Subcategory: Repositories

The `Repositories` subcategory provides links to the GitHub repositories that are relevant for a main topic.
Each repository that is linked here contains build and install instructions. In addition, the link to the GitHub
releases and the project boards of a repository are provided. Many of the main topics show synergy to other main
topics. Therefore, the links to other related repositories are also provided in this subcategory. As an example, 5G
Media Streaming is linked to topics such as 5G Core Networks and UE Data Collection.

## Subcategory: Tutorials

The `Tutorials` subcategory provides end-to-end setup instructions. These instructions guide you through the setup of a
specific technology or feature of a technology. Typically, the tutorials combine multiple repositories and components to create an end-to-end setup. Some tutorials
reference tutorials of a related topic. This subcategory also provides detailed instructions on how to use single repositories and components.

# Suggested Workflow

Depending on your interest and your level of knowledge, we suggest to follow this workflow:

1. Make yourself familiar with the high-level architecture of the technology you are interested in and the development status by following the
   `Scope` subcategory.
2. Check the `Roadmap` and `Repositories` subcategories to get an overview of the 5G-MAG Reference Tools. This is also a good starting point to map features
   from a specification to the corresponding repository and implementation.
3. If you are interested in trying out the tools, check the `Tutorials` subcategory.
