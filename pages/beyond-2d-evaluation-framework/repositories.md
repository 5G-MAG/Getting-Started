## FS_Beyond2D Evaluation Framework: [rt-beyond2d-evaluation-framework](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-beyond2d-evaluation-framework)

The FS_Beyond2D study is concerned with multiple Beyond 2D representations and service scenarios. This project contains scripts and configuration files for the reproducible evaluation of those scenarios. Source sequences, bitstreams and rendered out pose trace videos are available on different servers, as written in the TR.
